<p><strong>Sensor 04 OPT3001 DNPT  </strong>  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ambient Light Sensor - The OPT3001 is a sensor that measures the intensity of visible light. The spectral response of the sensor closely matches the photopic response of the human eye, with infrared rejection. It is a single-chip lux meter, measuring the intensity of light as visible by the human eye. The precision spectral response and strong IR rejection of the device enables the OPT3001 to accurately meter the intensity of light as seen by the human eye regardless of light source.</p>

<p><strong>Sensor 05    ZMOD44 10AI1V   TVOC (Total Volatile Organic Compounds)</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Designed for detecting total volatile organic compounds (TVOC). The ZMOD4410 is a 12-pin LGA assembly (3.0 x 3.0 x 0.7 mm) that consists of a gas sense element and a CMOS signal conditioning IC. The module’s sense element consists of heater element on a Si-based MEMS structure and a metal oxide (MOx) chemiresistor. The signal conditioner controls the sensor temperature and measures the MOx conductivity, which is a function of the gas concentration.</p>

<h2>Custom sensors</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can create a custom sensor as long as it conforms to
certain criteria, including size and safety. Your AmbaSat satellite provides
additional connectivity pins which expose the ATMEGA's I2C bus, as well as
digital and analogue pins, plus power. Please contact <a href="mailto:custom@ambasat.com">custom@ambasat.com</a> for more details.</p>
