# AmbaSat-1 KiCad

![AmbaSat-1 Motherboard PCB](AmbaSat-1_Satellite.jpg?raw=true "AmbaSat-1 Motherboard PCB")

## Summary

AmbaSat-1 KiCad conversions are derived from the Eagle design located at https://github.com/ambasat/AmbaSat-1

This version is functionally equivalent to the AmbaSat-1 design in the repository as of November 15, 2021.
The PCB layout retains the position of the two headers and the mounting hole.  Routing, footprints, and placement
of other items have been modified to improve reliability and manufacturability.  

## License

As of November 15, 2021, no license is published in the AmbaSat-1 repository,  
however the schematic contains Copyright 2020 by AmbaSat Ltd.

From https://ambasat.com/ambasat-2/faq/ (retrieved November 15, 2021):  

    *Q. Is this Open Hardware/Software?  
    Yes, all AmbaSat-1 software will be distributed under GNU GPL, a widely-used free software license, which guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share and modify the software. The AmbaSat-1 hardware is free hardware design, meaning hardware that users are free to use and to copy and redistribute with or without changes*

From https://github.com/ambasat/AmbaSat-1/blob/master/README.md (retreieved November 15, 2021):  

    *AmbaSat is Open Source Weâ€™ve learned a lot from the open source community. Electronics, hardware, coding, software libraries and much more.

    So, we want to give our work back to the maker and open source community.

    The AmbaSat satellite software is fully open-source and available for full download. The AmbaSat satellite hardware is also totally open source and the schematics and Bill of Materials (BoM) are available for download.

    What this means is that you can fully use all the above and create your own version of the AmbaSat satellite. Go ahead and use the schematic and source code and create your very own space satellite.*
